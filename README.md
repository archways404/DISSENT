# DISSENT

> **D**ecentralized **I**nfrastructure for **S**ecure **S**peech and **E**ncryption **N**etwork against **T**otalitarianism

**DISSENT** is not just a project — it's a digital middle finger to authoritarian regimes, invasive surveillance states, and bureaucrats pushing totalitarian legislation like the EU's disgusting **Chat Control**.

**Chat Control** is not about safety. 
It’s about control. It’s an Orwellian power grab masquerading as child protection — one that seeks to scan, monitor, and intercept all private communication under the false pretense of “nothing to hide, nothing to fear.”  
That’s not security — that’s tyranny.

DISSENT exists to dismantle these ambitions at the protocol level. It gives you what governments fear most: **liberty**.

No compromises. No backdoors. No masters.

> **Privacy is not optional. It is a human right — not a permission slip granted by the state. No government has the moral authority to decide who deserves privacy.**

### Why DISSENT?

- **Reject centralized control.**
- **End-to-end encryption by default.**
- **Federated & peer-to-peer communication.**
- **Impenetrable by design — resistant to backdoors and mass surveillance.**
- **Freedom of expression hardcoded.**
- **Built to oppose Chat Control and every cowardly regime that supports it.**

### "Nothing to hide, nothing to fear" is the mantra of fools.

If you’re fine being watched, recorded, scanned, and profiled — that’s your choice. But **no one** gets to make that choice for everyone else.

Surveillance is not safety.  
Silence is not peace.  
Compliance is not freedom.

**Stay free. Stay private.**  
**-DISSENT.**
