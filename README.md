# DISSENT

> **Decentralized Infrastructure for Secure Speech and Encryption Network against Totalitarianism**

**DISSENT** is a privacy-first, decentralized communication project built to resist government overreach, censorship, and mass surveillance — especially efforts like the EU's proposed **Chat Control** legislation.

It provides a secure, end-to-end encrypted environment for speech, data, and collaboration — without backdoors, central authorities, or compromises.

> **Privacy is not optional. It is a human right. DISSENT defends it.**
