# DISSENT

> **D**ecentralized **I**nfrastructure for **S**ecure **S**peech and **E**ncryption **N**etwork against **T**otalitarianism

**DISSENT** is not just a project — it's a digital middle finger to authoritarian regimes, invasive surveillance states, and bureaucrats pushing totalitarian legislation like the EU's proposed ***Chat Control 2.0*** ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_to_Prevent_and_Combat_Child_Sexual_Abuse)).

**[Chat Control 2.0](https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/)** is not about safety.
It’s about control — an Orwellian power grab masquerading as child protection — one that seeks to scan, monitor, and intercept all private communication under the false pretense of “nothing to hide, nothing to fear.”  
That’s not security — that’s tyranny.

DISSENT exists to dismantle these ambitions at the protocol level. It gives you what governments fear most: **liberty**.

No compromises. No backdoors. No masters.

> **Privacy is not optional. It is a human right — not a permission slip granted by the state. No government has the moral authority to decide who deserves privacy.**

### Why DISSENT?

- **Reject centralized control.**
- **End-to-end encryption by default.**
- **Federated & peer-to-peer communication.**
- **Impenetrable by design — resistant to backdoors and mass surveillance.**
- **Freedom of expression hardcoded.**
- **Built to oppose Chat Control and every cowardly regime that supports it.**

### "Nothing to hide, nothing to fear" is the mantra of fools.

If you’re fine being watched, recorded, scanned, and profiled — that’s your choice. But **no one** gets to make that choice for everyone else.

Surveillance is not safety.  
Silence is not peace.  
Compliance is not freedom.

### Roadmap

> **v0.0.1 → v0.1.0 — Proof of Concept** (Current)
- Built in **JavaScript** to validate architecture and feature set.
- Minimal protection against config file tampering, memory inspection, or forensic tools — focus is **function over fortress**.
- Implements basic client–server infrastructure with end-to-end encryption and decentralized federation.

> **v0.1.1 → v0.2.0 — Hardened Rebuild**
- Core components re-written in **C** or **Rust** to resist local file tampering, DMA attacks, memory scraping, and forensic analysis.
- Reduced attack surface by removing non-essential dependencies and abstractions.
- First real line of defense against state-level surveillance and data forensics.

> **v0.2.x+ — Growth & Optimization**
- Performance tuning and protocol optimizations.
- Advanced stealth features:
  - Traffic obfuscation and censorship resistance.
  - Onion routing, domain fronting, and protocol camouflage.
- New features to empower **secure**, **private**, and **unstoppable communication**.
- Continuous security audits and hardening to stay ahead of adversaries.
