# DISSENT

> **D**ecentralized **I**nfrastructure for **S**ecure **S**peech and **E**ncryption **N**etwork against **T**otalitarianism

**DISSENT** is not just a project — it's a digital middle finger to authoritarian regimes, invasive surveillance states, and bureaucrats pushing totalitarian legislation like the EU's proposed ***Chat Control 2.0*** ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_to_Prevent_and_Combat_Child_Sexual_Abuse)).

**[Chat Control 2.0](https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/)** is not about safety.
It’s about control — an Orwellian power grab masquerading as child protection — one that seeks to scan, monitor, and intercept all private communication under the false pretense of “nothing to hide, nothing to fear.”  
That’s not security — that’s tyranny.

**DISSENT** exists to make mass surveillance **impossible** — denying governments the tools to **violate privacy**.

> **Privacy is not optional.**
> **It is a human right — not a permission slip granted by the state.**
> **No government has the moral authority to decide who deserves privacy.**

### On CSAM and Misused Justifications
**DISSENT absolutely condemns child sexual abuse material (CSAM).**

Its existence is abhorrent and tragic, and fighting it is a moral necessity.

But authoritarian mass surveillance is **NOT** the solution.

- If governments cannot keep CSAM off the open internet, why should we believe they can magically eliminate it by scanning our **private devices and messages**?
- Mass device surveillance will not stop determined criminals — it will, however, destroy privacy for everyone.
- Every backdoor created “for safety” becomes a front door for **hackers**, **hostile governments**, and **corrupt officials**.

### What makes DISSENT unique?

- **No central kill switch**
  > Fully decentralized and federated. There’s no single company, server, or jurisdiction to pressure. Take one node down, the rest keep running.
- **Client-side encryption only**
  > Messages are encrypted before they leave your device, with keys that never touch a server unless you choose to share them (still encrypted end-to-end before transit). Even network operators can’t read them.
- **Metadata resistance**
  > Routes messages through Tor relays, obfuscates size and timing, and removes user identifiers. No accounts, no phone numbers — just conversations with no link to “who.”
- **Message compartmentalization**
  > Each message is independently encrypted. Cracking one reveals nothing about any others.
- **Persistence under attack**
  > If a server is seized, other servers retain the message. If none do, it will be resent until delivered.
- **Open-source & auditable**
  > Anyone can verify the code. No secret backdoors, and no way to silently add one without the world noticing.
- **Purpose-built to break Chat Control 2.0**
  > Unlike **[Signal](https://signal.org/)** or **[Telegram](https://telegram.org/)**, DISSENT’s architecture leaves nothing for mass-scanning legislation to grab onto. The protocol itself denies surveillance by design.

### "Nothing to hide, nothing to fear" is the mantra of fools.

If you’re fine being watched, recorded, scanned, and profiled — that’s your choice. But **no one** gets to make that choice for everyone else.

Surveillance is not safety.  
Silence is not peace.  
Compliance is not freedom.

### Roadmap

> **v0.0.1 → v0.1.0 — Proof of Concept** (Current)
- Built in **JavaScript** to validate architecture and feature set.
- Minimal protection against config file tampering, memory inspection, or forensic tools — focus is **function over fortress**.
- Implements basic client–server infrastructure with end-to-end encryption and decentralized federation.

> **v0.1.1 → v0.2.0 — Hardened Rebuild**
- Core components re-written in **C** or **Rust** to resist local file tampering, DMA attacks, memory scraping, and forensic analysis.
- Reduced attack surface by removing non-essential dependencies and abstractions.
- First real line of defense against state-level surveillance and data forensics.

> **v0.2.x+ — Growth & Optimization**
- Performance tuning and protocol optimizations.
- Advanced stealth features:
  - Traffic obfuscation and censorship resistance.
  - Onion routing, domain fronting, and protocol camouflage.
- New features to empower **secure**, **private**, and **unstoppable communication**.
- Continuous security audits and hardening to stay ahead of adversaries.
