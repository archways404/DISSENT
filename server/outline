The client sends a message to around 5 servers (predefined list in the config which can be edited if needed) and waits for a response from each server. If a server does not respond within a certain timeout, it is considered offline.

The servers should communicate with each other and keep a key value pair of active servers and inactive servers. New servers must let a "known" server know that they exist to be added to the list.

The send message to the original 5 servers will span out where each server will send it to 5 other servers, and so on...
